# carrot_vs_stick
Experimentation with a game created in HTML5.  Simple game with an Organizational Change Management theme.
Game can be played at:  http://www.carldgosselin.com/chasethelaggards

## Purpose:
I wanted to create a game using HTML5.  The initial code base is from a site called script-tutorials (www.script-tutorials.com/html5-game-development-lesson-4/).  

I modified the code to make stick figures move towards a carrot and run away from a stick... yup, that pretty much sums up my masters degree in Organization Change Management ;)
